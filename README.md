# DeepCode extension

<h3>
VS Code extension provided by <a href="https://www.deepcode.ai/">DeepCode.ai</a> to detect important bugs and issues in your code. Supports Java, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript and XML
</h3>
<h3>
DeepCode's AI algorithms continuously learn from bugs and issues fixed on open source
repos. The extension will automatically alert you about critical vulnerabilities you need to solve
in your code every time you save a file. Don't let security bugs go to production. Save time
finding and fixing them.
